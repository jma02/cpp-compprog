Traditionally, in the year 509, Brutus, the ancestor of Brutus, was credited for overthrowing the 
Etruscans. Thus, the Romans hated the idea of being ruled by kings. Through a prolonged period of reform
of Roman society (late fourth early third century), the republic was formed. 


Polybius -- provides an introduction to the structure of the republic. Covers the rise of Rome to the 
master of the Mediterranean world. Polybius says there are three main types of government. He says
there is monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. The opposites respectively are tyranny, oligarchy, and
mob rule. Monarchy gradually devolves into tyranny. Aristocracy to oligarchy, and democracy into mob rule.
History, to Polybius, was defined by this flow. Monarchy -> Aristocracy -> Democracy -> Monarchy ...


For Polybius, the best solution for this destructive cycle was a mixed constitution. For Polybius, the Roman
republic was a mix of all three governments. The Republic was comprised of three main bodies. The Chief
Magistracy, or Magistrates. They had the power to rule and command authority (Imperium). In the Roman world,
there emerged three levels of Magistrates. Aediles (Public works, buildings), the Praetors (judges),
and the Quaestors (legal trials, criminal procedure). The highest level of office was the Office of Consul.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Roman republic. Responsible for implementing policy. Overseeing direction
of the state. Chief of politics, and commanders at war. Generals. Consuls held absolute power.


The office of Consul would replace the power of the King. However, there were limitations of power.
There were two Consuls at any time. If the two consuls disagreed on policy, the consul supporting
the status quo would win (Generally, this meant non-action). The consuls were elected, and held
office for 1 year. Re-election would only be an option 10 years after serving as consul. Polybius describes
also, a system of checks and balances. The policies implemented by the consuls were approved by the senate.
The Senate, traditionally numbered 300, (Senate comes from latin word Cellectis, meaning old). Specifically
positions held by the heads of the Patrician class. They were a deliberative body which talked about
politics, policy, programs, money. Take for example, the Roman army. The Senate could approve funding for 
the army, but only the Consul could lead the army.


For Polybius, this system of mixed constitution was why Rome succeeded. The third branch of Roman government
was the assembly of citizens. Legislation initiated by the senators would ultimately need to be approved
by the assembly. Checks thus were placed on all branches of the Roman government. The Roman government was
designed to prevent concentrations of power. For a good time, it succeeded. 


There was one major flaw in the system. There was a fundamental inequality in the system. The Republic was 
dominated by the Patricians. There is another essential element of the Republic -- Classism. The Patricians
are the equivalent of today's one percenters. The Office of Consul was only open to the Patricians, the senate
was staffed purely by Patricians. College of Priests, purely seated by Patricians. In fact, the Priests
even had legal responsibilities. There was a position of office of chief priest, a position of great prestige,
and it could only be held by a Patrician. 


On the other end of the spectrum, were the Plebeians. The plebs were the small scale farmers, or craft artisans.
They held nearly no power. They were subjects of the Patricians. Everything in the Roman sociopolitical
order was weighted towards the Patricians. Another thing -- Plebeians were subject to Nexum -- debt bonds.
In order to maintain things like family farms, Plebeians had to take out loans. Interest rates in Rome were
horrible -- 80 - 100%. Loans would lead to debt bondage, which meant ultimately, slavery (because you
would never be able to work yourself out of debt). 


One thing that mitigated the inequalities of Roman socioeconomics was the system of Patrons and Clients.
Patricians would take on not so wealthy clients. Patricians would look after the clients, in exchange
for services. In the assembly -- clients would vote in interest of their patron. This system provided
some relief in the Roman society for Plebeians.


One further thing -- the reality of the class system in Rome was a little more complicated than just
Patricians and Plebeians. The Plebeians were a diverse group of people. The overwhelming majority of Plebeians
were poor subsistence farmesr, but there were also rich Plebeians. They were not rich in land, but they
were wealthy merchants. Money through trade meant little in Roman society -- you were still a Plebeians.
Still, these rich Plebeians had economic power, but no political / social power.


Who were the people of Rome? Rome's success was dependent on who the Romans were. The Roman character can be
described to the the effect of Soldier, Citizen, and Farmer. Polybius spends some time describing the
organization, the recruitment of the Roman military. Romans were expected to serve. They had a fundamental
sense of responsibility to defend their state. For much of the time of the Republic, the Roman military
was a citizen military. The Romans, did not until very late, develop a professional army. Roman service
in the military was a way of gaining glory, honor, and maybe even greater class. Glory and honor especially
for your family and city. Roman life was defined by this quest to obtain prestige for your family. Glorious
acts were rewarded with medals, coin, etc. In theory, this would motivate the Roman people to serve. There was
also a sense of national pride as the Romans had fought a series of defensive wars. 


Roman soldiers were marching to war with 40-50 pounds of gear, and they were building camps everywhere they
went. Polybius detailed precise and exact descriptions of the natures of Roman army camps. Every Roman camp
was built identically. The Roman army was very practical and pragmatic. The Romans were very practical.
For comparison, if the Romans and the Greeks were under attack, the Greeks would first break out into
committees and subcommittees, discuss the ethics of build bridging, philosophical questions, aesthetics, etc.
The Romans would just build the bridge. No matter the geography, a Roman soldier knew their camp. The greeks
would build their camps in the context of their geography. 


The Romans also had a very clear system of rewards for good behavior and punishments. Falling asleep on
guard duty was punishable by death. The Romans had a system for determining whether guards fell asleep on 
duty. They would have a system of passwords. Corroborating evidence for finding lazy soldiers.
Cowardice in battle -- punishable by death. Form of execution: A soldier sentenced to death would have to
run a gamut against his fellow soldiers, where he would be beaten to death, and stoned. Dereliction in duty
would also bring great dishonor to oneself and their family. The Romans had a special penalty called
decimation for derelicts. They would be lined up, and every 10th man was pulled out and killed. 


Thus, Romans would rather die in battle a glorious death. The Roman military encouraged all these aspects --
discipline, obedience, hard work, respect,  honor, pursuit of glory. This also reinforced a certain
fundamental pragmatism and conservatism that was consistent with the values of Rome.


The Romans were also farmers. Grapes. Romans actually had to provide their own equipment for farming. 
Farmers thus reinforced a sense of conservatism. Farming practice was passed down from generation to generation.
One could either farm the same way as their ancestors, or try something new. At worst, they could face
Nexum, thus, farmers didn't really try new things. 


Romans would of course still learn new things -- they weren't inflexible. 


Family was also very important to Roman society. For the Romans, family was everything. Roman marriage
was often arranged, there were political, economic, and social considerations. Men would find Romantic
attachments outside marriage, in fact. Marriage was designed for the propagation, continuation, and 
preservation of status. Fathers would not force daughters into marriages that they didn't want -- Romans loved
their children. Ritualistically, husband and wife were very loyal, but husbands would many times find
love outside their marriages. Of course, there were cases were marriages did in fact work out. The central
unit of Roman society was the family. Roman pursuit of glory was not a personal endeavour, it was motivated
by family. The Romans families were controlled by the father. The father was the chief authority of a Roman family.
The Roman family was also much broader, and extended past blood relatives. Patricians, for example, regarded
slaves as family. Ultimately, all peoples under one roof fell subject to the pater familias. 
In fact, adult male children were technically legally subject to their fathers. 


The mater familias still had prestige and respect, but nowhere near the father. Roman fathers could order
the execution of their own children. There is a story of a Roman commander who ordered his soldier not to 
engage in single hand-to-hand combat. His son went into single combat and won, and despite this, his father
still had him killed, because he disobeyed his father's orders. Adoption / abandonment was also commonplace. 
Were a family unable to care for another child, that child would typically be thrown out, ala Romulus and Remus,
and typically, those children would be adopted for sex and slave work. 


Romans also had, in their households, busts of their ancestors. The Romans believed that their ancestors
guided their decisions. Respect, conservatism, honor for their ancestors, all these aspects were
engrained in the Roman character. Traditionalism. 


Lastly, the Romans were deeply religious. In homes, there were shrines, genius. A genius was sort of
(bad analogy) like a guardian angel of a household. Genius were important deities. Protective figures were spread
across the Roman household. The olympian gods were also venerated. Especially Vesta, the god of Hearth fire.
There were fires constantly burning in Roman households. Religious rituals filled Roman lives. Wolfs
blood on doorways protected households. Romans believed you needed to carry the dead out feet first, because
they wouldn't know how to get back in this way. The Roman grooms also carried brides over thresholds. Romans
believed these religious rituals were essential to the success of their society. The Roman calendar was
filled with holy days. Lupercalia, a day of fertility, men dress in wolf skins, and run around the streets
with sticks, and young Roman women would hope to get tapped by these sticks to encourage fertility. There was
a sizeable overlap of private religious practices and public religious practices. On Roman roadways, there were
shrines, where Romans could make sacrifices, or say prayers, hoping that the spirits would protect them on
their travels. In the city of rome, there was a fire burning to honor Vesta, The temple of Vesta held this fire,
it was staffed by Vestal Virgins -- they were to be virgins, and they were to tend to Vesta. Vestal Virgins
also had freedoms such as freedome from the authority of their fathers. But they had to remain virgins. 
Vestal Virgins who broke their vows of viriginity would be buried alive. This was to prevent offending the
God, as the Romans believed that to stab, strangle, etc. the virgins would be an affront to the Gods. The such
virgin in fact, rather than enduring burial for breaking her virginity vow, committed suicide. Thus reverence
to the gods, the Romans believed, secured the empire's success. Before war, the Romans would perform ceremonies
to appease the gods, which they believed, brought them victory.


Summarily, the Roman Republic, traditionally founded in the year 509 BCE, and survived to the year 30 BCE.
The Romans faced two significant challenges throughout the republic's lifespan. First, the crushing inequality
in the republic due to the class system. Second, the military and political threats throughout Italy. Over
the 200 - 250 years since 509, they would face these two challenges.
